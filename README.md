CasparCG-PHP-ServerConnection
=============================

The CasparCG PHP ServerConnection is a class that is used to manage the connection to communicate with CasparCG Server(s) via the AMCP protocol.

Please check out the example.

Example2.php
This has been converted so you can pass variables to it and also enable chroma green. (add // to line 38 if you want to disable it.)
i.e. http://localhost/connector/example2.php?channel=1&layer=20&filename=AMB&button=play

You can also modify button=play, to stop or getinfo.

Big Thanks to tjenkinson for the original version. Was a huge help in getting setup with an easier way to push commands to CasparCG.
 on the iPad 
My setup so far is using ActionPad (https://itunes.apple.com/app/actionpad/id1142860715?ls=1&mt=8, "ActionPad") on the iPad to grab the webpage on the CasparCG server.
